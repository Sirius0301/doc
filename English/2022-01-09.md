## Epic Topic- E-Sport is a Atheletic Sport

### Sherry: Concept

#### 1. HOW DID ESPORTS COME TO BE RECOGNISED AS ATELETIC SPORTS?

Thanks to incredible technological advances, video games are now larger than life, with powerful game consoles and worldwide Internet connectivity allowing players to engage in intricate, highly detailed games with other players from all over the world. Now that high scores can be compared globally and games use deeply engaging 3D graphics with complex storylines and characters, they are interesting enough to be broadcast and watched by other people.

#### 2. ARGUMENT FOR E-SPORTS BEING ATELETIC SPORTS

The Oxford dictionary defines sport as “an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.” While eSports require more mental exertion than they do physical, this definition provides a pretty solid platform to argue that e-Sports are in fact real sports.

While esports have a lot of similarities to traditional sports like football, soccer, and basketball, it’s appearing to miss one thing: movement. Physical activity.  The fact is that competitive gaming is very much a sport, just not in the traditional sense.

#### 3. Esports athletes train just as hard as traditional athletes

Just like traditional athletes, eSport athletes spend countless hours mastering their sport and perfecting their skills. Some players have been known to train for up to 14 hours a day, sharpening their reflexes and quickening their reaction time.

One well known eSports athlete, known as Yellowstar, likens eSports to real sports by explaining, “If you perform, you are going to receive a lot of praise. If you were to miss or fail an action, you can bring your team down, affect your team’s performance and get a lot of blame.”

### Choni: Cucrrent Status

#### 1. Top esports athletes have physical advantages to the casual player

The pro player stayed focused on the center of the screen or on exact areas where he knew an enemy would be thanks to years of practice and a natural ability to multitask beyond the norm.

The esports athletes achieve up to 400 movements on the keyboard and the mouse per minute, four times as much as the average person. The whole thing is asymmetrical, because both hands are being moved at the same time and various parts of the brain are also being used at the same time.

Sitting on a couch will get you nowhere in competitive gaming. Professional gamers are usually a part of an organization or team, meaning they often live in a gaming house or frequent a training facility. The purpose of a team living together is to not only help them create a bond, but to make it easier to practice. 

To stay healthy enough to handle this pressure and intense practice, esports pros are utilizing the team’s personal trainers when they’re not scrimming. In order to stay fit enough to compete, teams often maintain a consistent gym routine. 

#### 2. More and more colleges offer Esports Degree Programs

Colleges, high schools – even parents and teachers – are embracing competitive electronic sports as a positive activity for students. Many wholeheartedly defend esports as a sport.
